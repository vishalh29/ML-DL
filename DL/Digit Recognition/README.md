# Handwritten Digits Classification Using Neural Networks

This demonstrates the classification of handwritten digits using neural networks. The project is built using TensorFlow and Keras and progresses through several models to demonstrate the impact of different neural network architectures on performance.

## Project Description

The notebook begins with a simple neural network model without hidden layers and progresses to more complex models including:
- A single-layer neural network
- A neural network with one hidden layer
- A neural network using a Flatten layer to simplify the input handling

Each model is evaluated on the MNIST dataset, a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.

## Requirements
